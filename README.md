During development, I encountered multiple bugs, but gained valuable experience in animation and audio systems while creating this first-person shooter project. Although it took me two weeks to complete, there are still some known bugs that I plan to address in the future.

Players can switch weapons by pressing 1 for an axe, or 2 for a revolver, followed by 3 through 8 for other weapons.
