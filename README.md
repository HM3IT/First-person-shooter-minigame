# First-person-shooter-minigame
This mini-game project is developed with the help of YouTube videos from [watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqb-Ue7wpsI&amp;t=5721s&amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

</br>
I encountered lots of bugs; I have gained new experienced in animation and audio systems with this first person shooter project.  </br>
It takes me two weeks to complete this project but __it still have bugs__ which I will come back to fix in the future.</br>

Player can change the weapon type by pressing 1 for axe, 2 for revolver followed by 3,4,5,6,7,8.
